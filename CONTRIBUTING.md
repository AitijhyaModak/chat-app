## How to Contribute

### Forking the Repository

1. **Fork** the repository by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   

### Creating a Pull Request
1. Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```
2. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message:

```bash
git commit -m "Description of the change"
```
3. Push your changes back to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

4. Create a pull request to the main repository's main branch. Provide a description of what you have done and why it is beneficial.
5. Make sure you include Fixes #issue_number or Closed #issue_number (Example- If you resolved #3 issue, then add Fixes #3)

Our maintainers will review your pull request. They may request changes or improvements. Once approved, your contribution will be merged!


## Best Practices
To ensure that contributions are consistent and maintainable, please follow these best practices:

1. Keep commits small and focused: A good rule of thumb is that each commit should represent one logical unit of work.
2. Document your code: Please add comments or documentation where necessary, especially for complex code or logic.
3. Test your code before creating a pull request.




## Thank you for helping improve Chat-App! We look forward to your contributions.
